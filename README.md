#
### Purpose:  In this project you are going to create the functionality and UI for a simple Giga Pet game. The purpose of this project is to make sure you have an understanding of JavaScript arrays, objects, click events on an element, and how to change properties in elements.
#### Requirements: To complete this project you will add to the starter code provided. You may use glitch or any editor that you prefer. For this project you can use the JQuery library. You may edit the structure of the provided HTML and CSS to better fit your preferred style. You may use lecture slides and the past hwâ€™s for sample code but make sure to make it your own.
#
## Functionality:
- Create a pet_info object with keys "name", "weight", "happiness" and set initial values. Set this equal to variable "pet_info"
- Add behavior to buttons When your pet receives a treat, add to its happiness and weight. When your pet exercises, reduce it's happiness and weight. When your pet plays, add to its happiness and reduce its weight
- Fix key bug to make sure keys can't go below zero (can use conditional)
- Add a new action button
- Add a new behavior that correlates with the new button you added. You can add it below the happiness text in the html
- Add a notification after each button press with a comment from your pet.
#
## What I will be grading on:
#### Implementation of all the functionality. JavaScript, HTML and CSS has proper formatting and comments where appropriate. Web page renders properly in Chrome. Any assets are included in submission. Make sure to change the provided image to a new image of your choosing.
#### To get full points show creativity and a desire to excel above and beyond.
#### Some Examples:
- Add animations and/or sound effects to your pet when certain conditions occur.
- Use object constructors to create multiple pets.
- Refactor code to not use JQuery
- Any other ideas can be discussed in class/canvas/email.
#### Cheating: This project will be an individual project. You can discuss this project with other students. You can explain what needs to be done and give suggestions on how to do it. You cannot share source code. If two projects are submitted which show significant similarity in source code then both students will receive an F for the project. Note a person who gives his code to another student also fails the project (you are facilitating the dishonest actions of another).
